# Genetic Algorithm Simulation

This project provides a conceptual overview and basic implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** â€” a search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. The simulation demonstrates how GA can be used to evolve solutions to optimization problems.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- Step-by-step implementation of a Genetic Algorithm in C++.
- Simulation of selection, crossover, and mutation processes.
- Configurable parameters: population size, mutation rate, number of generations.
- Clear code structure for educational purposes.

## What is a Genetic Algorithm?
A Genetic Algorithm is a method for solving optimization problems based on the principles of **natural selection** and **genetics**. It involves:
- **Initialization**: Generate an initial population of potential solutions.
- **Selection**: Select the fittest individuals for reproduction.
- **Crossover**: Combine two parents to form offspring.
- **Mutation**: Randomly modify genes to maintain diversity.
- **Termination**: Stop after a fixed number of generations or when an optimal solution is found.
